# what is the problem
Dietary choices and nutrition behaviors are highly individual and changes day to day. 

Many variables weigh heavily on a person's food choices:

- Access to food
- Work/school schedule
- Taste preference
- Culture

The decision of what foods to eat is further complicated by

- A person’s knowledge/understanding of diet and nutrition
- The Internet (media, online forums, etc.)
- Social media

All these factors make idenfitfying factual and unbiased information regarding nutrition an increasingly difficult task.

Some consistent features are important when it comes to human diet and a person’s choice of nutritional intake. Some traits about food are quantifiable aspects of the food’s nutrient content.

First is macronutrient content

- Carbohydrates
- Protein
- Fat

Macronutrients are essential components of human diet and provide the calories (energy) required for the body to function.

Second is micronutrient content

- Vitamins
- Minerals

Micronutrients are also necessary for all of the functions of living.

Information about nutrient content can be found in places like the Nutrition Facts panel on food packaging or in database resources. The combination of this quantifiable information regarding nutrient content in food and the variables impacting food selection like taste, access, and culture all contribute to a person’s dietary patterns.

*While it is largely difficult for scientific methods to account for all of the individual variations of diet preferences and access, information regarding nutritional content of food can be leveraged to develop data driven interpretations of foods.*
