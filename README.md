# Uncovering-the-Nutritional-Landscape-of-Food

Our project will focus on demystifying what we should eat. Starting with the datasets provided by the [USDA](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/download-datasets.html) and the analysis performed in [Uncovering the Nutritional Landscape of Food](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/citation?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0118697) we will make an interactive dashboard using [Streamlet](https://streamlit.io/) to visualize which food are most nutritious.
